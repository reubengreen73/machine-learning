# My machine learning experiments

This repository contains a few IPython notebooks I've created while studying machine learning, for the benefit of anyone who might
want to get an idea of what I can do. Each directory contains one small project, as explained below.

### NYC Bedbugs
This project takes a dataset containing details of bedbug infestations in New York City between 2018 and 2022, cleans and processes
it, and then attempts (without much success, admittedly) to apply some models to it.

The files in this directory are
- **NYC Bedbugs - data processing.ipynb** a notebook which cleans and processes the raw dataset
- **NYC Bedbugs - using processed data.ipynb** a notebook which attempts to apply do some modelling on the processed data
- **Bedbug_Reporting.csv** the raw data in csv format
- **NYC Bedbugs processed.csv** the processed data in csv format
