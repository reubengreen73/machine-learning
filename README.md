# My machine learning experiments

This repository contains a few IPython notebooks I've created while studying machine learning, for the benefit of anyone who might
want to get an idea of what I can do. Each directory contains one small project, as explained below.

### NYC Bedbugs
This project takes a dataset containing details of bedbug infestations in New York City between 2018 and 2022, cleans and processes
it, and then attempts (without much success, admittedly) to apply some models to it.

The files in this directory are
- **NYC Bedbugs - data processing.ipynb** a notebook which cleans and processes the raw dataset
- **NYC Bedbugs - using processed data.ipynb** a notebook which attempts to apply do some modelling on the processed data
- **Bedbug_Reporting.csv** the raw data in csv format
- **NYC Bedbugs processed.csv** the processed data in csv format

### Room Occupancy
This project is a replication of the methods in *Machine Learning-based Occupancy Estimation Using Multivariate Sensor Nodes*
(Singh, Jain, Chaudhari, Garg, in *Communication, Computing, and Networking in Cyber Physical Systems 2018*).

The files in this directory are
- **room occupancy replication.ipynb** the notebook containing the replication
- **Occupancy_Estimation.csv** the dataset used, in csv format

### Tetuan Power Consumption
This project is my take on the work done in *Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for the Power Consumption Prediction: Case Study of Tetouan
city* (Salam and El Hibaoui 2018, in *2018 6th International Renewable and Sustainable Energy Conference*).

The files in this directory are
- **power consumption.ipynb** the notebook containing the calculations
- **Tetuan City power consumption.csv** the dataset used, in csv format
