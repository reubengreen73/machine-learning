    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook I present an implementation of the method of *Machine Learning-based Occupancy Estimation Using Multivariate Sensor Nodes* (Singh, Jain, Chaudhari, Garg, in *Communication, Computing, and Networking in Cyber Physical Systems 2018*). My purpose in doing this is, firstly, to increase my familiarity with techniues of machine learning, and secondly to demonstrate my knowledge for anyone who might be interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original paper and the dataset used may be found on the UC Irvine ML repository at [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/864/room+occupancy+estimation].\n",
    "\n",
    "## The original work\n",
    "The original paper presents an evaluation of different ML algorithms for estimating the number of occupants of a room using data from non-intrusive sensors. The dataset used was generated over four days in an office room equipped with sensors to measure temperature, light level, sound intensity, and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, as well as a PIR sensor to detect motion. Measurements from these sensors were recorded every 30 seconds, together with the number of people in the room (via a sign-in/sign-out system). The final feature in the dataset is an estimate of the\n",
    "slope of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (obtained from the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration data). See the paper for more detail on how the data was generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was then used to assess the performance of five different ML algorithms for estimating the number of people in the room from the sensor data: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with both linear and rbf kernels. Accuracy and F1 scores were obtained for these methods using 10-fold cross validation. Further, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimension of the dataset, and the above algorithms were also applied to this principal component data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My implementation\n",
    "I have attempted to implement the algorithms as described in the original paper in this notebook. However, I have not been able to fully implement some aspects due to the limited computational resources available to me. Full details are given below, but in summmary my personal computer is not able to run some of the SVM training algorithms in a reasonable timeframe and so I have compromised by running these algorithms on a sub-sample of the dataset.\n",

This is the point where I have been unable to perform a full replication of the paper's method due to the limited computational resources at my disposal. In the paper, each combination of kernel and feature set is run with different values of the penalty hyperparameter, which I will henceforth in accordance with convention and scikit-learn's notation call *C*. Unfortunately, some of the calculations with high values of C run for multiple hours on my system without finishing, and so I have implemented a strategy where only a small sub-sample of the dataset is used to tune the hyperparameter, and then in *some* cases the full data set is used to assess the performance of the algorithm with this tuned value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So note that this section is not a true recreation of the method in the paper**\n",
    "\n",
    "The description of the implementation of the SVM models given in the paper is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "> In case of SVM, the training set features were normalized to have\n",
    "zero mean and unit variance since the algorithm is scale-\n",
    "variant. The normalization constants from the training set were\n",
    "used to scale the testing set at each iteration of the cross\n",
    "validation loop. Apart from linear SVM, we also evaluated the\n",
    "results with RBF kernel to allow for non-linear classification\n",
    "boundaries. The penalty hyperparameter was varied from 10<sup>−4</sup>\n",
    "to 10<sup>4</sup> for each feature set and the best metric value is\n",
    "reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have interpreted this to mean that for each combination of model (i.e. SVM with linear kernel or SVM with rbf kernel) and feature set, accuracy and f1 score are calculated (via 10-fold cross-validation with normalization) for each *C* in $\\{0.0001,0.001,0.01,0.1,1,10,100,1000,10000\\}$ and the best accuracy and f1 score obtained are reported (i.e. the reported accuracy and f1 score may come from different *C* values).\n",
    "\n",
    "My compromise implementation is as follows. For each combination of model and feature set, we first make a sub-sampling of the dataset by choosing every 100th record for non-PCA derived feature sets, or every 30th record for PCA-derived feature sets (see below for the logic behind this difference). We then calculate accuracy and f1 score for each *C* value in the set given above by 10-fold cross-validation with normalization using this sub-sampling. We repeat this sub-sampling and calculation a total of 10 times at different offsets into the data, average the scores over these 10 repetitions, and choose the *C* values which give the best values of these metrics. If these chosen *C* values are equal to or less than 100, we recalculate the metrics for these *C* values on the full dataset and report the accuracy or f1 score thus obtained, but if *C* is 1000 or 10000 then we just report the value from the sub-sampling. We make a record of which reported values were computed using just the small sample, so that we can mark these \"suspect\" values in the final analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen different sub-sample factors for the PCA-derived and non-PCA-derived feature sets. This is tenable since we shall not be directly comparing the PCA-derived and non-PCA-derived feature sets in our final analysis. We want to use the largest possible sub-sample, and for the non-PCA-derived feature sets a 30-fold reduction in the size of the dataset produces acceptable running times. However, for the feature set with one principal component, the *C* = 10000 case runs for hours on my machine without terminating. Thus for the principal component feature sets it is necessary to choose a bigger reduction in dataset size, and 100-fold seems to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature which I have had to implement to enable the code to run with the resources I have available is that, when we are performing the sub-sampling of the data to tune the hyperparameter *C*, we impose a time limit of 10 minutes on each calculation of accuracy and f1 score. If any calculation fails due to timeout, we ignore that sub-sampling and try another one instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory behind my approach is that (according to some brief reading) the running time of an SVM classifier is polynomial in the input size. The exact polynomial degree depending on the kernel and the value of *C*, but it seems that it is typically between 2 and 3 (i.e. between quadratic and cubic). Thus cutting the input size can dramatically cut the running time."
